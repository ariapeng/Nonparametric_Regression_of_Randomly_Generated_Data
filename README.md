# Nonparametric_Regression_of_Randomly_Generated_Data

Ninety-nine randomly generated observations with one dependent variable and one independent 
variable are given as the data of interest. Our goal is to find the best nonparametric regression line.

LPR and cubic spline methods are applied to fit the data of interest in nonparametric sense. Comparing 
the MSE obtained with 10-fold cross validation, we conclude that cubic spline with LOOCV offers the 
best model performance while avoiding an overfitting issue.
